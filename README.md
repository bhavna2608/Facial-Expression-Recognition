# Facial-Expression-Recognition

## Objective
To develop a model for facial expression classification using state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques, targeting 7 distinct expressions.

## Approach
1. Integrated EfficientNet-B0 architecture, a PyTorch model, leveraging pre-trained weights from the ImageNet database.
2. Applied data augmentation, implemented custom training and evaluation loops, and optimized the model using the Adam optimizer.

## Result
Achieved a training accuracy of 79.4% and a testing accuracy of 64.5% in a single run across 15 epochs.
